              In sociology, anthropology, and linguistics, structuralism is the
              methodology that implies elements of human culture must be
              understood by way of their relationship to a broader, overarching
              system or structure. It works to uncover the structures that
              underlie all the things that humans do, think, perceive, and feel.
              Alternatively, as summarized by philosopher Simon Blackburn,
              structuralism is "the belief that phenomena of human life are not
              intelligible except through their interrelations. These relations
              constitute a structure, and behind local variations in the surface
              phenomena there are constant laws of abstract structure".

              The input range must be a linear series of numbers. The output
              range can be any value type supported by Framer Motion: numbers,
              colors, shadows, etc.
